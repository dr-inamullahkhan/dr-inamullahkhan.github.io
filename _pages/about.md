I am currently a **Research Fellow** at the <a href="https://people.smu.edu/kabdelghany/team/" target="_blank">Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Bobby B. Lyle School of Engineering, Southern Methodist University</a>, Texas, working on the **Innovation Engine Project** funded by the <a href="https://new.nsf.gov/funding/initiatives/nsf-engines" target="_blank">National Science Foundation (NSF)</a>.  
I hold a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering (Data Science Focus) from <a href="https://www.research.lancs.ac.uk/portal/en/people/inam-ullah-khan(3bbefee2-0e6c-4869-8974-265b232520e0).html" target="_blank">Lancaster University</a>, UK, where my research focused on **data-driven modeling and control in smart grids**.  
I also earned my Master’s degree in Electrical Engineering (Power Systems) from <a href="https://www.comsats.edu.pk/" target="_blank">COMSATS University Islamabad</a>, Pakistan.

Previously, I worked as a **Research Fellow** at <a href="https://www.edgehill.ac.uk/research/ivc/members/" target="_blank">Edge Hill University</a> and <a href="https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Lancaster University</a>, UK, and as an **Assistant Professor** at <a href="https://lahore.comsats.edu.pk/Employees/902" target="_blank">COMSATS University Islamabad</a>. I have contributed to multiple high-impact funded projects from NSF (USA), the British Council (UK), and the EU, delivering AI-driven solutions in **smart grids, wireless networks, and cyber-physical systems**.

## Research Interests
* Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning
* Smart Grids and Renewable Energy Integration
* Electricity Theft Detection and Grid Security
* Big Data Analytics & Forecasting
* Optimization for Power and Communication Systems

My work has led to **15+ peer-reviewed publications** in top-tier IEEE and Elsevier journals, with over **10,000+ downloads on IEEE Xplore**. I have designed **stacked ensemble learning models**, **synthetic data generation techniques**, and **novel boosting algorithms** that improved prediction accuracy by up to **23%**.  

I am particularly interested in **bridging the gap between AI theory and real-world applications**, enabling resilient, sustainable, and secure infrastructure systems.

## Prospective Collaborations
I am always open to research collaborations, particularly in interdisciplinary projects involving AI, power systems, and critical infrastructure. If you are interested in working with me, please make your email subject line **"Collaboration with Dr. Inam Ullah"** and include your CV and a concise research proposal.
