## **_Innovation Engine Project: Data-Driven Mapping of U.S. Innovation Deserts_**
_Research Fellow – Southern Methodist University, Texas (NSF-Funded)_

This project focuses on identifying and benchmarking “innovation deserts” across 3,222 U.S. counties to inform regional policy interventions. Leveraging **Kernel PCA (KPCA)** with **Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)**, the work has achieved an **11% reduction in model training cost** and a **15% improvement in anomaly detection AUC** through synthetic data generation and hybrid model development.  
Key outputs include a **carbon-penalizing objective function** for renewable energy integration optimization and **dashboard-driven KPIs** to guide prioritization across 65 U.S. metro areas.
